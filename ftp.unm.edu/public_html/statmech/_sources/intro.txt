Introduction
============

Statistical Physics is the central topics of physics. It taught us great lessons about nature and it is definitely going to teach us more. Some ideas even put thermodynamics and statistical physics as the fundamental of all theories thus the thought that everything is emergent has been announced.

Basicly, statistical mechanics is the mechanics of large bodies.

* Mechanics is Newton's plan of kinematics.
* Large means a lot of DoFs. Usually DoFs add up to :math:`10^23` which is the order of Avogadro's number.
* Bodies, of course, is the subject or system we are dealing with.
