Stress-Energy Tensor
--------------------


In general, the stress energy tensor is the flux of momentum $p^\mu$ over the
surface $x^\nu$. It is a machine that contains a knowledge of the energy
density, momentum density and stress as measured by any observer of the event.

Imagine a (small) box in the spacetime. Then the observer with a 4-velocity
$u^\mu$ measures the density of 4-momentum $\d p^\alpha\over\d V$
in his frame as:

.. math::

    {\d p^\alpha\over\d V} = -T^\alpha{}_\beta u^\beta

and the energy density that he measures is:

.. math::

    \rho = {E\over V} = -{u^\alpha p_\alpha \over V}
    = - u^\alpha {\d p_\alpha\over\d V}
    = u^\alpha T_{\alpha\beta} u^\beta
