Maxwell's Equations
===================

Electromagnetic Field
---------------------

The electromagnetic field is fully described by a vector field called the
4-potential $A^\alpha$. It has four components that we can label any way we
want, the traditional way is to use:

.. math::

    A^\alpha = \left({\phi\over c}, {\bf A}\right)
