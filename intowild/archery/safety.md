### Do Not Kill Yourself



#### Safety of the archer

Before you start to draw a bow, search archery accidents on google.

1. **Check the arrow make sure they don't crack**. If the arrow crack at the bow, it might hit the archer. Bend the arrow slightly to check it. Bad arrow make a cracking sound. If you don't understand how could a broken arrow kill you, search on google ["carbon arrow break"](https://www.google.com/search?q=carbon+arrow+break&espv=210&es_sm=119&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=nkE8U_KwJZO4yAHF54CgDw&ved=0CCoQsAQ&biw=1276&bih=706#facrc=_&imgrc=8UOhBXTKF4QyCM%253A%3BgKHCWu3zRRjrEM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.outdoorlife.com%252Ffiles%252Fimagecache%252Fphoto-single-upscale%252Fphoto%252F30010%252Fimagejpeg954.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.outdoorlife.com%252Fblogs%252Fbig-buck-zone%252F2010%252F04%252Fspring-fever-advisory%3B640%3B480) or ["aluminum arrow break"](https://www.google.com/search?q=carbon+arrow+break&espv=210&es_sm=119&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=nkE8U_KwJZO4yAHF54CgDw&ved=0CCoQsAQ&biw=1276&bih=706#q=aluminum+arrow+break&tbm=isch&imgdii=_).
2. **Arrow should match the # of the bow or it will break and hit yourself.** One example of back matching is shot a wooden arrow with an high power compound bow. Never do that or you might kill yourself.



#### Safety of the bow

1. **Never dry fire a bow!** It's like short circuit! As the battery or the bow has to consume all the energy itself, damage will be done.
